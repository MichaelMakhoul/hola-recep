/**
 * Plain JS port of src/lib/prompt-builder/generate-prompt.ts
 * and legacy prompt handling from src/lib/knowledge-base/aggregate.ts.
 *
 * Ported from TS source at commit c6c1f05. When the TS version changes,
 * diff against that commit to identify what needs updating here.
 *
 * Only includes functions needed at runtime (no Zod, no UI presets, no analysis plan).
 *
 * Key behavioral difference: the TS version references calendar tool-calling
 * (get_current_datetime, check_availability, book_appointment) in scheduling
 * instructions; this JS version replaces those with message-taking guidance
 * since the self-hosted voice server has no calendar tool integration yet.
