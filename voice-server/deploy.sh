# Deploy the voice server, then force the expensive wake so a CALLER never pays it.
# Use this instead of a bare `fly deploy`.
#
# SCRUM-579: the app runs with min_machines_running = 0, so the machine stops
# when idle. Twilio's read timeout for call webhooks is hard-capped at 15s, and
# a real call landing on a slow wake falls through to the fallback URL: the
# caller hears "our system is temporarily unavailable" and a status: "failed"
# row lands in the business's call log.
#
# WHY THE STOP BELOW — measured 2026-08-23, and it is the whole point of this
# script. `fly deploy` leaves the machine STARTED, so curling /health right
# after a deploy hits a running machine in ~80ms and absorbs nothing. The
# expensive wake (~14.5s: the host re-pulls the image) lands on the FIRST wake
# after the machine subsequently autostops — i.e. on whoever calls next.
# Observed: deploy 06:19:54Z left it started; it autostopped by 06:25:14Z; the
# wake at 06:25:15Z pulled the image and took 14.5s; the next wake, image now
# host-cached, took 5.9s.
#
# So we stop it ourselves and wake it ourselves. The deploy has already
# restarted the machine at this point, so the stop costs no additional call
# disruption. (Based on one measured deploy — if a future deploy shows a pull
# at deploy time instead, this stop becomes unnecessary rather than harmful.)
